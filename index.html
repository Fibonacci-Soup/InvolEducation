    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>We are an education start-up founded in King's College, Cambridge. All our members, from our founder to our teachers, have been enrolled at Cambridge or Oxford. Our members are experienced. Over the past 8 years, we have sent more than 30 students to Cambridge and Oxford, and every student we coached has received offers from G5 universities. We provide top-notch, highly personalised education and application coaching for students targeting Oxbridge and G5 universities. We take pride in being educators. We believe the application process is a process of self revelation and growth, and we help students discover their passions and shine. We forge paths tailored to each student's specific needs to help our students achieve their ambitions. In the past, we have worked individually; now, we are starting off as a team.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="strengths">
    <h2>Strengths</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Our all-Oxbridge team guarantees quality</strong><p>We know what is expected of a successful Oxbridge applicant, and we weave the Oxbridge standard into our curriculum to match our students with the highest requirements.</p></li>
      <li><strong>We are veterans of the application process</strong><p>We have experienced the application process as well as the anxiety, fear and dread that comes with it. We empathise with students and their parents, and have largely maintained good relationships. </p></li>
      <li><strong>We offer customised service</strong><p>Unlike most application institutions in the industry, we take great care to identify each student's personalised needs, and use our expertise to guide our students to their destination. The growth paths among students are hugely different; using a factory-line approach usually ends in dissatisfaction. </p></li>
      <li><strong>We know the rules</strong><p>We keep close touch with professors who made application decisions, and some of our teachers even participated in the decision-making process of Oxbridge undergraduate application. Therefore, we have unique insights in the qualities Oxbridge is looking for as well as the common mistakes applicants make. We make proactive efforts when coaching students to prepare for application. </p></li>
      <li><strong>We offer Oxbridge-standard education</strong><p>We extract the essence of what we learned in Oxbridge and teach them to our students. Our teachers focus not only on the knowledge itself, but also more importantly on the Oxbridge mindset â€“ the rigour in reasoning, the focus on clarity and precision, the practice of systematic learning and so on, and mastering this mindset will pay huge dividends. Every student of ours can enjoy an Oxbridge experience, no matter their application result. </p></li>

    <h2>Services</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Supervision and research projects</strong> <p>Our customised projects usually take ten to twelve lectures. The first half of the lectures is dedicated to theoretical teaching, and our teachers have carefully selected Oxbridge course materials suitable for high school students. The second half is dedicated to the application of those theories and knowledge. Students will tackle an issue from the real world, and the result usually take the form of a short research paper or a model </p></li>
      <li><strong>Personal statement coaching</strong> <p>This includes brainstorming, planning, writing multiple drafts and final polishing. Writing is a craft, and our teachers follow closely the writing principles of well-known authors. We take care to guide students through the writing process. Many students came in without any idea of what to write; they left with impressive personal statements rich in both accuracy and authenticity. </p></li>
      <li><strong>Interview preparation</strong> <p>The Oxbridge interview is similar to a college supervision or tutorial. With our experience, we help students visualise the atmosphere and overcome their nerves. We use past interview questions to train our students, guiding them to respond in a clear and precise manner that is valued by Oxbridge academics. We also emphasise the soft skills, such as showing passion and confidence â€“ skills that are crucial yet too often overlooked by Chinese applicants. </p></li>
